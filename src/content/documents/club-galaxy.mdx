# Club Galaxy

Located in the heart of Rylands, **Club Galaxy** opened its doors in 1982 and quickly became a staple in Cape Town’s nightlife—especially for the Coloured community during the late apartheid years.

## History

Through the decades, Galaxy evolved from a disco-era venue into a home for live R&B, house, and eventually kwaito music. The venue survived turbulent political times, racial segregation, and the digital shift in nightlife.

## Notable Events

- **1991** - *Kwaito Night Launch*: Helped define a generation of township music lovers.
- **1997** - DJ Ready D residency began, bringing turntablism to the Cape Flats.
